## Project description
A website is utilized during employee training to familiarize them with the POS system and the recipe for each drink.

## Features
There are 3 modes:
1. **Finding Drinks** 
* To improve efficiency in locating drinks when a customer orders, employees are presented with a random drink and asked to find it on the simulated POS system. This exercise helps employees become faster in locating drinks when needed.
2. **Sugar Level**
* In this mode, a drink with random levels of sugar and ice is presented, and employees must correctly choose the appropriate sugar level. This helps speed up the drink-making process without needing to refer to the recipe.
* There are several modes available, including 16 basic drinks, milk tea, smoothies, and more.
3. **Wintermelon Sugar Level**
* For wintermelon drinks, employees must dilute the sweetness by adding water. In this mode, a random drink is presented, and employees must select the correct amount of water to add to the cup.
